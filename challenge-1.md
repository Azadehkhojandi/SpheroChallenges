The sphero drags the charriot across the room, displays an icon on the LED panel to request an item and then we load the item and the sphero carries it back.  The team who gets the items the fastest, or gets the most items wins.  We could limit the # of each item to 3 and the teams need to deal with what happens if an item is not available.
