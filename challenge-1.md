### Exploration - History of Chariots
In ancient times, people used something called a “chariot” (a cart, usually pulled by horses) to haul materials, build things or even race against each other.

Draw a sketch of what a horse-drawn chariot looks like. Be as detailed as possible, but draw based on what you already know. Don’t look online (yet!)

Your challenge is to design and build a Sphero chariot. Watch the video below for a quick glimpse into what you will be doing.
