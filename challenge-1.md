# Challenge 1: Chariot Challenge

Design and create a Sphero chariot, then create a program for Sphero to navigate the race course.

The sphero drags the charriot across the room, displays an icon on the LED panel to request an item and then we load the item and the sphero carries it back.  The team who gets the items the fastest, or gets the most items wins.

### Exploration - History of Chariots
In ancient times, people used something called a “chariot” (a cart, usually pulled by horses) to haul materials, build things or even race against each other.

Draw a sketch of what a horse-drawn chariot looks like. Be as detailed as possible, but draw based on what you already know. Don’t look online (yet!)

Your challenge is to design and build a Sphero chariot. Watch the video below for a quick glimpse into what you will be doing.

Review the Engineering Design Process image. Refer back to it throughout to better focus your efforts during the process.
