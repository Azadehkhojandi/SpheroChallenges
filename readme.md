## Challenges

* [Challenge 1: Chariot Challenge](challenge-1.md)
* [Challenge 2: public/private key puzzle](challenge-2.md)

### Customer Style Meetings
The challenges are a little vague. It’s important to consult with your customer to refine the requirements!

The trouble is the customer is time poor – so you’ll only have 1 minute to ask questions. Booking the customer incurs a minimum 15 minute delay. You can only have one booking at a time. 

### What is the acceptance criteria to complete the challenge?
NFRs should include a cloud component, contribution by everyone on team (with roles for dev lead, PM, etc), use of agile practices, backlog, testing, CI/CD, etc.  

### How we pick the winning team? 
we will use "point" system.  So winning the challenge gives 10 points, 8 points, 6 points, 4 points for each 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th place... but then having a PM, cloud component, CI/CD, backlog, etc, adds 2 more points.... You could lose the challenge, but win the competition because you had all the NFR components.

### A little help with CI/CD
