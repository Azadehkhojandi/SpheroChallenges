# Challenge 2: public/private key puzzle


The challenge is, write a word on paper, and send it to the judges so they can read it. 

But… it must not be readable by someone who might intercept the Sphero on the journey. 

In your toolbox you have a series of numbered locks. You can add your own locks and remove them. 

The judges also have a series of numbered locks. The judges can add their own locks and remove them. 

The judges cannot remove your locks and you cannot remove their locks. 

Hint – adding or removing a lock should modify the text in some way!
